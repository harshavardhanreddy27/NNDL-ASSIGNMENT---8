Neural Networks and Deep Learning Assignment - 8
### Import Libraries
The necessary Python libraries are imported for data loading, model creation, and visualization.The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The images are normalized and reshaped to be compatible with the autoencoder model.

The architecture of the autoencoder model is defined using the Keras functional API. The model consists of an input layer, encoder layers, and decoder layers.

The autoencoder model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

The autoencoder model is trained using the training data. The training process is monitored, and the training and validation loss are recorded.

The reconstructed images are visualized alongside their original counterparts for comparison.

### 7. Plot Loss and Accuracy

The training and validation loss are plotted to visualize the performance of the autoencoder model during training.
